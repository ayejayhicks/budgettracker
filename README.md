# Budget Tracker
## Purpose
To add functionality to an existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.

## Description
Once the application becomes fully functional the user will be able to add expenses and make deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

## Challenges and Successes
Challenges: Finding a starting place on the assignment with not much direction from the ReadMe. Using what I have learned and trusting that I can complete this assignment was a huge hurdle.

Successes: Having a good starting point after reviewing past activities and reading documentation.

## Technologies Used
Express.js  
Node.js
MongoDB  
Mongoose
